The WristTec wristband uses inertial motion tracking technology and 3D model comparisons, taking advantage over Bosche mocap sensors and our very own motion capture software. The project is still in its early stages but we have made significant progress in developing a prototype of the device and the mobile application. The project is aimed to be released in late 2027 or early 2028.",
